      <h1><span style="color:blue">
Lesson 1 -Basics of the Web</span></h1>
      <p>In this lesson, we'll cover HTML, URLs, HTTP, and Web apps.</p>

      <div>
        <p><b>The World Wide Web (WWW)</b> is a collection of HTML docs (HTML = hyper text markup language), that glue everything together through the use of links (hyper links), thus creating the web. Invented in the early 90s, there are now 30+ billion
          pages.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>Several major "pieces" of the web are inter-related and work together, including You :), a computer running a browser, the internet, and servers. The internet and servers talk to each other through http.
          </p><p>
      </p></div>

      <div>
        <p><b>HTML</b> is short for <u>h</u>yper <u>t</u>ext <u>m</u>arkup <u>l</u>anguage, which is made up of... text content - what you can see; markup - what it looks like; references to other docs or files with associated attributes (images/videos,
          etc.), and links to other pages.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><b>HTML markup</b> is made of <u><b>tags</b></u>. There is an opening tag, followed by content, and then a closing tag. Each tag is named by a tag description within brackets. An entire tag is called an <u><b>element</b></u>. <b>HTML attributes</b>          are <i>tag</i> attributes that ascribe a value, and tags can have multiple values. An example of an <u><b>attribute</b></u> assigned to a tag is an anchor. <u><b>Anchors</b></u> are for making links, like assigning a URL as an attribute to piece
          of content.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><b>Image tags</b> don't have a closing tag and are called a void tag if they don't have a closing tag, because these kinds of tag have no content. Good web coding citizenry occurs when coders assign alternate text to display when an image doesn't
          load, even though doing so isn't required. It's also important to remember that all line spaces must be defined, forcing breaks through the use of tags.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p><b>Inline or block tags</b> are used to simply end a line of text, and are void tags like line break = br. Block tags make an invisible box for the text, and these can be assigned height and width. Span is an example of an inline tag that represents
          text, and div is an example of a block tag that behaves like a paragraph tag and creates a box around the tagged section.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>There is specific nomenclature associated with defining an <b>HTML Document</b>. Doctype specifies the type of document at the beginning, followed by the opening doc tag, like html. This indicates the beginning of the document. After this identificaiton,
          attributes like head, title, etc., are included and this is where CSS guidelines would be defined. After the head and title tags, the body of the document is coded.</p>
      </div>
  </div>


  <div style="background-color:orange; color:white; padding:10px;">
    <style>
      h1 {
        color: white;
        font-family: century gothic;
        font-size: 125%;
      }
      
      h2 {
        color: white;
        font-family: century gothic;
        font-size: 135%;
      }
      
      color:white;
      font-family:century gothic;
      font-size:125%;
      p {
        color: white;
        font-family: avenir;
        font-size: 100%;
      }
    </style>

        <h1><span style="color:blue">Lesson 2 - Basics of Learning to Code</span></h1>

        <div>
          <div>
            <p>In this course, we are learning to understand the <b>basics of the Web and HTML</b> and see HTML as a web page, ultimately creating our own simple page. This will include creating a structured doc with HTML and adding style to structure with
              CSS. We'll learn to avoid repitition using HTML and CSS Style classes.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2><b>How Learning to Code Works</b></h2>
            <p>Whenever we learn anything, we begin as novices. Learning is a continuum of moving from being novices to becoming experts. The goal of this course is for learners to <i>gain ability</i> in most fundamental programming concepts, and <i>awareness</i>              of many concepts beyond this class.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>As learners, we go through stages of expertise, including...</p>

            <div>
              <p><b>Ignorance</b> - In this stage, a novice could feel like they lack any awareness or understanding of the topic, but this is where every journey to master begins.</p>
              <p><b>Awareness</b> - Learners can move quickly from Ignorance to Awareness.</p>
              <p><b>Ability</b> - It takes a little more time to reach ability, but it is at this stage that learners begin to use their newfound, possibly still rudimentary, skills</p>
              <p><b>Fluency</b> - It takes the longest amount of time to reach ths level, but it is here that learners have reached expert status.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <div>
            <h2><b>How the Web Works/How HTML is structured</b></h2>
            <p>Front-end web development is visual. You get to <b>SEE</b> what you develop in a browser as you create it, so there's immediate gratification and early rewards. Yay! :) HTML, CSS, and Java script have different purposes when developing a web
              page. Each purpose is related to how you break down a visual design to create a web page:</p>
            <div>
              <p><b>Structure</b> - HTML is like the structure of a house
                </p><p>
                  </p><p><b>Design</b> - CSS is like decorating the house... the wall color, artwork, architectural details, etc.</p>
                  <p><b>Modification</b> - Java script is like any changes you make to the house, like when a garage door opener changes the structure of the house by opening the garage door</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><i>But wait, how does the browser read this?</i> Code has a <u>tree-like structure</u>. Instructions for the browser are found in HTML's tree-like structure. While HTML and CSS are both languages, HTML controls the <i>structure</i> of the
                web page while CSS controls the <i>style</i> of the page (how it looks). When a programmer talkes about the <u>DOM (Document Object Model)</u>, they are talking about the tree-like structure of the page - which is how the browser understands
                the page.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>There are <i>shared attributes</i> as well as <i>differences</i> across HTML, CSS and DOMs. HTML has language, syntax and rules; as does CSS. HTML uses tags to describe content, which can be empty or contain another element, and tags can
                ascribe attributes and values in addition to describing content. Totally clear, right? :) Like a set of nesting dolls, the tree-like structure of HTML provides the structure and content of the page from the outermost variable to the innermost.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p>Similar to HTML, CSS also has language, syntax and rules, but uses it's language to designate the <b><i>style aspects</i></b> of the page - i.e., what style to use and where to get it. Unlike HTML and CSS, DOM doesn't get down to the level
                of describing the content or style of the page, but is instead the standard convention for interacting in HTML and describes the elements in the tree.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b><span style="color:blue"><u>Supporting definitions:</u></span></b></p>
              <p><u><b>HTML</b></u> - Hypertext Markup Language</p>
              <p><u><b>CSS</b></u> - Cascading Style Sheet; style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language</p>
              <p><u><b>DOM</b></u> - Document Object Model; a cross-platform and language independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of each document are organized in a tree structure,
                called a DOM tree.</p>
            </div>

            <p><i>What's the difference between scratchpad, codepen and sublime?</i></p>

            <div>
              <p><b><u>Scratchpad</u></b>
                <br> most beginner friendly
                <br> speed of feedback: immediate feedback
                <br> ease of use: great for beginners
                <br> ease of sharing: impossible
                <br> power/professionalism: low
                <br> number of languages: 2 - HTML and CSS</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b><u>Codepen</u></b>
                <br> speed of feedback: 2-3 seconds
                <br> ease of use: fewer beginner friendly features
                <br> ease of sharing: easy, but requires an account
                <br> power/professionalism: very high
                <br> number of languages: 3 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p><b><u>Sublime</u></b>
                <br> speed of feedback: on page refresh
                <br> ease of use: difficult in beginning
                <br> ease of sharing: difficult
                <br> power/professionalism: highest
                <br> number of languages: all * the languages</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>Note: For now, it's best to start by writing your code in scratchpad and write CSS inside of an element in <u>Scratchpad</u>. Then if you want to share your code, use <u>Codepen</u>. Later, we'll use <u>Sublime</u> to write code that we'll
              save and write on our computer.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p><i>How do I share code i've written in Codepen for free?</i></p>
            <p>Sign up for the free codepen account, and click "create a new pen", enter your code. Then, in editor, you can pick full page option, which creates a URL that you can copy and paste and share with anyone!</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p><i>How do I open code I've written in Sublime in a web browser?</i></p>
            <p>There's a tiny icon at the top of the window that you can drag and drop into the browser address bar. When you drop it there, your web site will display.</p>
